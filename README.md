Compiled using Eclipse 2020-03 with JavaSE 11, JavaFX 11.0.2, GSON 2.8.6

I created a file named 'items-filtered.json' that uses the 'items-complete.json' file available [here](https://www.osrsbox.com/projects/osrsbox-db/). This file only contains equippable items from OSRS, and is a significantly smaller file
