# OSRSDpsCalculator
DPS calculator for Old School RuneScape

Based on [Bitterkoekje's Google Sheets DPS calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wzy1VxNWEAAc0FQyDAdpiFggAfn5U6RGPp2CisAHZW8/edit)

Compiled using Eclipse 2020-03 with JavaSE 11, JavaFX 11.0.2, GSON 2.8.6

I'm not using SceneBuilder for the layout, so it's all done in code by hand.

I created a file named 'items-filtered.json' that uses the 'items-complete.json' file available [here](https://www.osrsbox.com/projects/osrsbox-db/). This file only contains equippable items from OSRS and is significantly smaller than the original. I did a similar thing for the 'monsters-filtered.json' file.
